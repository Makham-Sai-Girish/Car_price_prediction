Project : Predict the price of used car
Gradient Boosting Regression Ml Model : 90% accuracy
Tasks done : 
Collected data of used cars from various websites like olx, cars24, cardekho 
Data size - 12070 rows x 11 columns.
Columns: Type of columns : Data type of them 
Code used to scrape from the websites is provided.
Developed the machine learning model to predict the price of the used car.
Different algorithms are used to make the model. 
Gradient Boosting Regressor is the model i considered as best by comparing to other. 
Accuracy achieved is 78% initially.
By Hyper Parameter Tuning, accuracy increased to 90%
